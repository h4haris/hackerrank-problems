Relation R(A,B,C) has the following tuples:

A B C
1 2 3
4 2 3
4 5 6
2 5 3
1 2 6

and relation S(A,B,C) has the following tuples:

A B C
2 5 3
2 5 4
4 5 6
1 2 3

The differences (R-S) is computed and the following tuple is found to be present in the result. Assume that the schema of the result is (A,B,C).

4, b, c

Find the integers b and c. Fill in the values in the answer box, each on a new line.

Output Format

Two integers, corresponding to b and c, each on a new line.

Ans: 
2
3

Explanation:
After R-S, 423 and 126 remains.
If a=4 then b=2 and c=3
