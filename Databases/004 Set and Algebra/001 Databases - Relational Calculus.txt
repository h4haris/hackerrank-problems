We execute the following query (in Relational Calculus) on a set of integers S.
For the given set S, what will be the answer? Fill up the answer box with the required integer.

{x|A y S(x) ^ S(y) -> y <= x}

S = {4,5,6,7,10,11,19,18,3}

Ans: 19

Explanation: Find an element in set X, such that for all elements in Set(X) and Set(Y), there is a function where y is less than or equal to x.

Therefore, the greatest element in the given set S will be the element x needed as an answer since no other element can be greater than that.
