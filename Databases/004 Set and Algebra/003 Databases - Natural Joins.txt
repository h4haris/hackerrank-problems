Relation R(A,C) has the following tuples:

A : C
3,3
16,4
12,3
3,15
27,1

Relation S(B,C,D) has the following tuples:

B : C : D
50,1,6
1,55,8
4,3,9

The following tuple is in the result of the natural join between R and S where tuples are structured as (A,B,C,D):

27, X, Y, Z

In the answer box, fill up the values of the integers X, Y and Z in three separate lines.
