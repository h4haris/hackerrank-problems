Consider the following two designs to store the data using clustered indexes in MS SQL Server:
In the first design, the fill factor is 20% and the total number of free rows per page are A.

In the second design, the fill factor is 40% and the total number of free rows per page are B.

Which the followings describes the relation between A and B:
A = 1.33B
B = 1.33A
A = 0.67B
B = 0.67A

Ans: A = 1.33B

Explanation:

if total number rows in design of A = total number rows in design of B,

A = 0.8x AND B = 0.6x

then

x = A/0.8 = B/0.6

A = (B / 0.6)*0.8

A = (0.8 / 0.6)* B

A = 1.33B
