The following unnormalized table named PRODUCT is transformed to first normal form (1NF) by splitting it into two tables which have X and Y rows (such that X <Y) respectively. Both the tables have Z columns.

*Product-ID*    *Colors*    *Price*
1               Red,Green   15.0
2               Blue        18.0
3               Yellow,Pink 2.5

What are the values of X, Y, Z? Enter these integers, each on a new line, in the text-box below. Do not leave any leading or trailing spaces.

Ans: 
3
5
2

Explanation: if we decompose the table into 1NF we need to remove multivalues from the given table
