A database, normalized as per 2NF rules, has been split into 10 tables. Each of the tables has exactly two columns: one key attribute and one non-key attribute. What is the minimum number of tables required to express this database in 3NF form? Enter the integer in the text box below. Do not leave any leading or trailing spaces.

Ans: 10

Explanation:
The database is currently in 2NF with 10 tables Each table has: 1 key attribute 1 non-key attribute To convert from 2NF to 3NF: Any non-key attribute that is transitively dependent on the key is removed into a separate table Since each table already has only 1 non-key attribute, there are no transitive dependencies possible within a table. Therefore, no further normalization is needed to achieve 3NF. The 10 existing tables satisfy 3NF requirements So if the database has 10 tables in 2NF, with 1 key and 1 non-key column each, then the same 10 tables also represent the 3NF form.

Minimum number of tables required for 3NF = 10
