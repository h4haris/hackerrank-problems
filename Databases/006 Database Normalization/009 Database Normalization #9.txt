Consider the following relation and determinants. The key(s) are bolded. (a & b)
R(a, b ,c,d,e)

Which of these determinants is a NON-CANDIDATE key? Answer the index number (1-3) of the dependency which you have identified as non-key.

1. a,c -> b,d,e

2. a,d -> b

3. a,c,e -> b,d

Ans: 2

Explanation:  a candidate key should define all the attributes of any relation. in second depandancy (a,d) is not defining all the attributes of the relation(a,b,c,d,e)
